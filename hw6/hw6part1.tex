\noindent \textbf{Part 1: Social Network Modeling} \\

\noindent This part is intended to get you started on the
project. \textbf{You may work with your project teammates and submit
	the same solution for this part only.} \\

\noindent Refer to the specification of the \textsf{Nicebook} social
network provided for the course project (\textsf{Social Network
	Spec.pdf}). Consider the description under the section \textbf{Basic
	Concepts} only (i.e., disregard operations or privacy settings for
this homework). 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Construct an object model diagram for the social network.
	      
	      You may use any drawing tool of your choice and include the graphics
	      file as a figure in LaTeX\footnote{One freely available is Google
		      Drawings: \url{https://docs.google.com/drawings}}. Alternatively, it is acceptable to draw
	      the diagram by hand as long as it is legible.

	\item List at least one constraint from the above problem description that cannot be
	      expressed on this diagram.

        \textbf {Answer:} The following are the constraints that cannot be expressed on the object model diagram
            \begin {enumerate}
                \item $ \forall a, b: User \bullet b \in a.friends \implies a \in b.friends $\\
(If $a$ and $b$ are users then $a$ is friend of $b$ implies $b$ is friend of $a$)
                \item $ \forall a : User \bullet a \notin a.friends $\\
                    (If $a$ is a user then $a$ cannot be friend of $a$)
                \item $ \forall a : User \bullet \forall t : taggedUser.a \bullet t.taggedBy \subseteq t.friends $ \\
                    (If $a$ is a user then $a$ can only be tagged by $a$â€™s friends)
            \end {enumerate}
	\item Construct an Alloy model for this system. Your model must
	      include:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item A set of signatures and relations, but not operations or
		            privacy settings.
		      \item A predicate called \texttt{invariants} that defines the
		            set of constraints that every valid instance of the model must satisfy.
		      \item A \texttt{run} command called \texttt{GenerateValidInstance} that generates only valid instances.
	      \end{itemize}
	      Name your model file \texttt{hw6-1.als}  and submit it on
	      Canvas. In addition, include a copy of your Alloy model in your
	      Gradescope submission. 
\end{enumerate}
